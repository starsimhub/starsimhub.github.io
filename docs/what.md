# What is Starsim?

Starsim is a framework for modeling the spread of diseases among agents via dynamic transmission networks. Starsim supports:

- **Co-transmission** of multiple diseases at once, capturing how they interact biologically and behaviorally
- **Non-infectious diseases**, either on their own or as factors affecting the transmission or mortality of infectious diseases
- Detailed modeling of **mother-child relationships** starting from conception, allowing investigation of infant and childhood diseases
- Multiple types of **transmission network**, including theoretical (e.g. Erdős–Rényi) and realistic (e.g. age-assortative sexual partnerships)
- Different **intervention types**, such as vaccines or treatments, and showing their impact through different delivery methods such as mass campaigns or targeted outreach
- Automated **calibration** to data, plus careful handling of random numbers to minimize variance between simulations

Starsim is available for both Python and R, and is fully open-source under the MIT license.
